# GENDER INCOME GAPS IN THE UNITED STATES

## SEMESTER AND CLASS TITLE

Fall 2017, DATA 550 Data Visualization - Dr. Bora Pajo

## DESCRIPTION 

The gender pay gap in the United States is the ratio of female-to-male median yearly earnings among full-time, year-round workers. While many believe that the gender gap is overstated in the United States. This analysis attempts to show if the gender gap does exist accross various industries. The extent to which discrimination plays a role in explaining gender wage disparities is somewhat difficult to quantify, due to a number of potentially confounding variables. Analysis thus far has found that there is indeed a sizable gender gap between male and female incomes.

## ABOUT THE DATA

This dataset, retrieved from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows the median weekly incomes for 535 different occupations. The data encompasses information for all working American citizens as of January 2015. The incomes are broken into male and female statistics, preceded by the total median income when including both genders.
