# GENDER INCOME GAPS IN THE UNITED STATES

## SEMESTER AND CLASS TITLE

Fall 2017, DATA 550 Data Visualization by Dr. Bora Pajo

## DESCRIPTION

Many people say the gender gap in income levels is overstated in the United States, where some say that inequality in the labor force is a thing of the past. Is there a gender gap at all? Is it stronger in some industries than in others?

This dataset, retrieved from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows the median weekly incomes for 535 different occupations. The data encompasses information for all working American citizens as of January 2015. The incomes are broken into male and female statistics, preceded by the total median income when including both genders. The data has been re-formatted from the original PDF-friendly arrangement to make it easier to clean and analyze.

Analysis thus far has found that there is indeed a sizable gender gap between male and female incomes. Use of this dataset should cite the Bureau of Labor Statistics as per their copyright information:
